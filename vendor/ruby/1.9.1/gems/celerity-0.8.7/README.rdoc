== Description

Celerity is a JRuby library for easy and fast functional test automation for web applications.

Celerity is a JRuby wrapper around HtmlUnit â€“ a headless Java browser with 
JavaScript support. It provides a simple API for programmatic navigation through
web applications. Celerity provides a superset of Watir's API.

== Features

* *Fast*: No time-consuming GUI rendering or unessential downloads
* *Scalable*: Java threads lets you run tests in parallel
* *Easy to use*: Simple API
* *Portable*: Cross-platform thanks to the JVM
* *Unintrusive*: No browser window interrupting your workflow (runs in background)
	
== Requirements

* JRuby 1.2.0 or higher
* Java 6
