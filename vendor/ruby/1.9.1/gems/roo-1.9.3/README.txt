== DESCRIPTION:

Roo can access the contents of various spreadsheet files. It can handle
* Openoffice
* Excel
* Google spreadsheets
* Excelx


== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

You don't need to have an installation of Openoffice or Excel. All you need is
the spreadsheet file. It's platform independent so you can read an Excel file
under Linux without having to install the MS office suite.

Roo implements read access for all spreadsheet types and read/write access for
Google spreadsheets.


== SYNOPSIS:

  require 'rubygems'
  require 'roo'

  s = Openoffice.new("myspreadsheet.ods")      # creates an Openoffice Spreadsheet instance
  s = Excel.new("myspreadsheet.xls")           # creates an Excel Spreadsheet instance
  s = Google.new("myspreadsheetkey_at_google") # creates an Google Spreadsheet instance
  s = Excelx.new("myspreadsheet.xlsx")         # creates an Excel Spreadsheet instance for Excel .xlsx files

  s.default_sheet = s.sheets.first  # first sheet in the spreadsheet file will be used

  # s.sheet is an array which holds the names of the sheets within
  # a spreadsheet.
  # you can also write
  # s.default_sheet = s.sheets[3] or
  # s.default_sheet = 'Sheet 3'

  s.cell(1,1)                                 # returns the content of the first row/first cell in the sheet
  s.cell('A',1)                               # same cell
  s.cell(1,'A')                               # same cell
  s.cell(1,'A',s.sheets[0])                   # same cell

  # almost all methods have an optional argument 'sheet'.
  # If this parameter is omitted, the default_sheet will be used.

  s.info                                      # prints infos about the spreadsheet file

  s.first_row                                 # the number of the first row
  s.last_row                                  # the number of the last row
  s.first_column                              # the number of the first column
  s.last_column                               # the number of the last column

  # limited font information is available

  s.font(1,1).bold?
  s.font(1,1).italic?
  s.font(1,1).underline?
